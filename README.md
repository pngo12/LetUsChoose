# What's this repo do?!

**LUC** (Let Us Choose) is a random food/activity generator for the picky person (or group).

Built off the Yelp Fusion API, LUC takes in what type of food you're craving or an activity, your location, and will choose for you.

If you're into surprises or spontaneous then LUC is perfect for you.
